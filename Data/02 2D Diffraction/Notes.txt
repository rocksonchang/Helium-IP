A sample data showing diffraction of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) from an optical lattice.  Shown are the observed velocity distributions of a BEC after diffraction from a 2D optical lattice.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Each frame shows the velocity distribution for an increasingly strong diffraction (lattice depth).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The physics at work here is analogous to light diffraction from a multiple slit structure, except here the light has been replaced by an atomic matter wave. Atoms passing through each slit can coherently interfere with atoms passing through another slit, creating a rich interference pattern visible in the velocity distribuion.
