At high temperatures, the atoms in our system act as particles -- like billiard balls bouncing around.  As we reduce their temperature, a new, wave-like, behavior begins to emerge.  This wave-like behavior we can characterize with a de Broglie wavelength.  As we cool the initially thermal atoms, the atoms come closer and closer together and their de Broglie wavelength becomes longer and longer.    We eventually reach the point where the deBroglie waves of each particle begin to overlap.  At this point, we can no longer think of our system classically as a collection of particles, but we must also account for their wave-like nature.  When we do this, what we find is that atoms will begin to fall into the same quantum mechanical state -- the ground state of the system.  The population in this lowest energy state is called a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).  For a much better explanation:
